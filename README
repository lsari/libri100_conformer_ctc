=== Requirements ===
pytorch
librosa
pandas

Install from source: https://github.com/githubharald/CTCDecoder
Note: I had to change the CTC decoder to this ones as the ctcdecode installation failed with newer version of the remaining libraries


=== Running the setup ===
Assuming that you have already downloaded the Librispeech dataset,

1) python prep_data.py <your-dataset-dir-ending with /Librispeech>
   This extracts features and creates pandas dataframes
2) Create a hyper-parameter json file using:
   python template_for_args.py
3) Run training
   mkdir checkpoints_1
   python -u train_seed_arg.py train_1.json checkpoints_1
   Note: current setting is tested on single GPU
4) Run testing
   python test_wer.py train_1.json checkpoints_1/checkpoint_99.pt


=== Results ===
    	    CER	WER
dev-clean   9.64	28.8
test-clean  9.63	28.9

=== Acknowledgment ===
Thanks Xiaohui Zhang for fine-tuning the hyper-params
